### Hi, I’m @rRubedog!
- I’m interested in learninng how to make the back end of websites to make them more "interactable".
- I’m currently learning JavaScript and I'm still learning new things all the time about HTML and CSS.
- I’m looking to collaborate on helping make the front end of some websites in the future.
- Contact me through my email: rubedog.p960@gmail.com
